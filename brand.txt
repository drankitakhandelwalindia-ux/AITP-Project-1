I am launching MishTee-Magic, a D2C brand for artisanal Indian sweets.

The focus is on Purity (A2 milk, Organics ingredients) and health-first sweets (low-sughar, low-gluten).

Based on a Terracotta and Gold aesthetic, suggest:

3 Pithy Slogans (e.g., 'Heritage in every bite').
A short 2-sentence 'Our Story' blurb for the customer login page.
Names for 4 'Collection' categories (e.g., 'The Saffron Series')."
Structure your response in tabular format with columns 'Group' (e.g., slogan) and 'Output' (e.g., bullet pointed for each slogan)
